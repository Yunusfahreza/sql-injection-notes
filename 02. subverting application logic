In url: `https://0a6800c5033f4d7081096cde00500076.web-security-academy.net/`
- Click to `My Account'
- Enter username `administrator'--`
- Enter password with random string

Explanation:
- SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''
- an attacker can log in as any user without the need for a password. They can do this using the SQL comment sequence -- to remove the password check from the WHERE clause of the query.
- This query returns the user whose username is administrator and successfully logs the attacker in as that user.
